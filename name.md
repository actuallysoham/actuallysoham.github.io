## About My Name

### Pronunciation
- **IPA**: /ˈsoʊ.həm deɪ/
- **Simple**: So-hum They
- **Bengali**: সোহম দে

### Etymology & Meaning

The name Soham (सोऽहम्) is a Sanskrit phrase that means "I am He" or "I am That", referring to the idea of unity between the individual self and the universal consciousness. It is often associated with Advaita Vedanta, a non-dualistic philosophy that emphasizes the oneness of the self (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).

### Sanskrit Roots & Meaning
The word is a sandhi (combination) of two Sanskrit words:

- सः (Sah) – meaning "He" (referring to the Supreme Being or ultimate reality)
- अहम् (Aham) – meaning "I"

When combined in Sanskrit phonetics, Sah + Aham contracts to Soham (सोऽहम्).

### Origins & First Usage
The phrase "Soham" is deeply embedded in Hindu spiritual traditions, particularly in Vedic and Upanishadic texts. It is often found in:

- The Isha Upanishad and Mandukya Upanishad, which emphasize the non-duality of the self and Brahman.
- The Shivagama texts, where it is linked to Lord Shiva and self-realization.
- Tantra and Kundalini Yoga, where it is used as a mantra for meditation and breath control (Pranayama). The natural sound of breathing—"So" when inhaling and "Ham" when exhaling—symbolizes the unity of the self with the universe.

In short, Soham is an ancient Sanskrit mantra representing self-realization, oneness, and spiritual awakening, with roots tracing back to Vedic India over 3000 years ago.
